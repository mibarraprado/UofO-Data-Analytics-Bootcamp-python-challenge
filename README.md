# UofO-Data-Analytics-Bootcamp-python-challenge

This assignment contains two Python scripts for analyzing financial data and election results. The script (main.py) within the PyBank folder reads a .csv file with financial records to return a .txt file with the analysis results. The script within the PyPoll folder reads the election data stored in a csv file and returns the number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes, and the name of the final winner of the election. 

PyBank Instructions
Run the main.py Python script within the PyBank folder to analyze the financial records in a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset comprises two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

This script  opens and reads the budget_data.csv to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll Instructions

Run the main.py Python script within PyPoll folder to expedite an election vote-counting process. This script reads a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
This Python script calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won.

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on the popular vote
